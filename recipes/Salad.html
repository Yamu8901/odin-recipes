    <H2>Smoked Salmon Sushi Rolr</H2>
    <p>Homemade salmon roll made with sushi rice, nori, and smoked salmon. This is a very basic and easy recipe for making sushi. It might take a while to learn how to make a perfect roll, but you'll have fun trying! Add wasabi (Japanese horseradish) for a good kick!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Japanese sushi rice
        </li>
        <li>
            Rice wine vinegar
        </li>
        <li>
            Dry Seaweed(Nori)
        </li>
        <li>
            Wasabi Paste
        </li>
        <li>
            Smoked Salmon(long stripes)
        </li>
        <li>
            cucumber(peeled and Sliced)
        </li>
        <li>
            Avocado(pitted, peeled and sliced)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak rice for 4 hours. Drain rice and cook in a rice cooker with 2 cups of water. Rice must be slightly dry as vinegar will be added later.</li>
        <li>Immediately after rice is cooked, mix in rice wine vinegar; spread rice on a plate until completely cool.</li>
        <li>Place 1 sheet of seaweed on a bamboo mat; press a thin layer of cool rice on seaweed, leaving at least a 1/2 inch top and bottom edge of the seaweed uncovered. This is for easier sealing later. Dot some wasabi on rice; arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado on rice about 1 inch away from the bottom edge of seaweed.
        </li>
        <li>Slightly wet the top edge of seaweed; roll up tightly from the bottom to the top edge with the help of the bamboo mat. Cut salmon roll into 8 equal pieces and serve. Repeat for other rolls.</li>
    </ol>
